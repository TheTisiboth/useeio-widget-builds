This repository contains experimental builds of the [USEEIO
Widgets](https://github.com/USEPA/useeio-widgets). The `docs` folder contains
the current build which is hosted on Github pages under this address:

[http://msrocka.github.io/useeio-widget-builds/](http://msrocka.github.io/useeio-widget-builds/)

You can also easily test this locally by hosting the content of the `docs`
folder on a server, e.g. when you have Python installed:

```bash
git clone # or just download it
cd useeio-widgets-builds/docs
python -m http.server
```
